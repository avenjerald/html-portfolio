<h1>The Best Movies According to JC</h1>

<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>Officer Black Belt</h3>
<p>
  Officer Black Belt is a Korean movie about a man who is recruited by a
  probation officer to help monitor individuals on probation who wear ankle
  monitors. I personally love it because the main character lives an honest life
  and always strives to do what is right, no matter the circumstances.

<h3>Divergent</h3>
<p>
  I love the idea of factions, just as much as I love the concept of houses in
  Harry Potter. The plot, especially the idea of people who can't be confined to
  just one faction—called Divergent—really resonates with me. I feel like I can
  relate. While we don’t have literal factions in real life, I often feel like
  I’m capable of doing many things, without belonging to just one particular
  category.

<h3>The Maze Runner</h3>
<p>
  I really love the concept of The Maze Runner. I often find myself wondering
  what I would do if I were one of them. I'm especially inspired by how
  courageous many of the characters are.
